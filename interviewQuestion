Catalog Price Rules:
Catalog Price Rules represent promotions on category or product pages and
Catalog price rules do not use coupon codes.

Cart Price Rule:
 applies promotions to the Cart in the Checkout phase. Offers like coupon code, free shipping, discounts in order total, buy 1 get 1 free, etc., are examples of Cart Price Rule.
Cart price rules create discounts for orders at the checkout level, based on a set of conditions. The discount can be applied automatically when the conditions are met, or be applied when the customer enters a valid coupon code. At the point when applied, the discount shows up on the shopping cart page under the subtotal.
We can add catalog price rules under Marketing > Promotions > Catalog price rule.
